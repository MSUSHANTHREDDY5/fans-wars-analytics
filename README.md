# ⚡ Fan Wars Analyzer (Reddit-Gmail)

> **Autonomously compares fanbases of two celebrities using Reddit data and AI-driven sentiment analysis — powered by n8n, OpenAI, and automated email reporting.**

## 🎯 Overview

The **Fan Wars Analyzer** is an *Agentic AI* workflow that dynamically analyzes and compares the fanbase activity between any two celebrities based on real Reddit discussions.  
Users simply send an input like `"Messi vs Ronaldo"` along with their email — the system automatically fetches posts, analyzes engagement and sentiment, considers recent real-world context (like a match, award, or controversy), and sends a structured comparison report to the user’s inbox.
